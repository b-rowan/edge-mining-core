# Consumption Forecast

## Description

The `ConsumptionForecast` entity represents a prediction of energy consumption patterns for the home or or a specific load. It contains time-series data mapping timestamps to predicted power consumption values, enabling the optimization system to make informed decisions about future energy needs and mining operations scheduling.

## Properties

| Property          | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `predicted_watts` | A dictionary mapping timestamps to predicted power consumption values in Watts. Each entry represents the expected energy consumption at a specific future time. |
| `generated_at`    | The timestamp indicating when this forecast was generated, used to track forecast freshness and validity.                                                        |

## Relationships

- **Used by `DecisionalContext`**: A `ConsumptionForecast` can be part of the [`DecisionalContext`](decisional_context.md), providing crucial information about expected future energy requirements of the home or a specific load.
- **Generated by Home Forecast Providers**: Home Forecast services or local algorithms generate `ConsumptionForecast` instances based on historical consumption patterns and other factors.
