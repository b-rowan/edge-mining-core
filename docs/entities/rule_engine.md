# Rule Engine

## Description

The `RuleEngine` entity serves as the computational engine that evaluates automation rules within the Edge Mining optimization system. It acts as an intermediary between the optimization policies and the actual rule evaluation logic, providing a standardized interface for processing different types of automation rules against system context data. This entity abstracts the complexity of rule evaluation, enabling flexible and extensible decision-making logic.

## Properties

The `RuleEngine` is defined as an abstract service interface, with concrete implementations providing specific evaluation algorithms. The entity itself doesn't have traditional properties but rather defines behavioral contracts for rule processing.

## Relationships

- **Used by [`OptimizationPolicy`](optimization_policy.md)**: The optimization policy delegates rule evaluation to the rule engine for consistent processing.
- **Processes [`AutomationRule`](automation_rule.md)**: Takes collections of automation rules and evaluates them against system context.
- **Analyzes [`DecisionalContext`](decisional_context.md)**: Uses comprehensive system state data to determine if rule conditions are satisfied.

## Key Operations

- **`load_rules(rules)`**: Prepares a collection of automation rules for evaluation by loading them into the engine's processing context.
- **`evaluate(context)`**: Core evaluation method that processes loaded rules against the provided decisional context and returns True if any rule conditions are met.

## Rule Processing Workflow

1. **Rule Loading**: Accepts a list of automation rules and prepares them for evaluation
2. **Context Analysis**: Examines the decisional context to extract relevant data for rule evaluation
3. **Condition Matching**: Iterates through loaded rules and evaluates their conditions against context data
4. **Priority Handling**: Processes rules according to their priority levels
5. **Result Determination**: Returns boolean result indicating whether any rule conditions were satisfied

## Evaluation Logic

- **Sequential Processing**: Rules are typically evaluated in priority order until a match is found
- **Short-Circuit Evaluation**: Evaluation may stop at the first matching rule for efficiency
- **Condition Parsing**: Interprets rule conditions dictionary to determine evaluation criteria
- **Data Type Handling**: Manages different data types and comparison operations within rule conditions
- **Boolean Logic**: Supports complex condition combinations within individual rules

## Rule Types Supported

- **Threshold Rules**: Numeric comparisons against energy production, consumption, or battery levels
- **Time-Based Rules**: Scheduling and temporal condition evaluation
- **State Rules**: System status and operational state matching
- **Forecast Rules**: Future-looking condition evaluation using prediction data
- **Composite Rules**: Complex conditions combining multiple criteria

## Implementation Patterns

- **Strategy Pattern**: Different rule engines can implement varying evaluation strategies
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible design allows for custom rule evaluation logic
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient rule processing for real-time decision-making
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management for invalid or malformed rules

## Usage Scenarios

- **Energy Optimization**: Evaluating energy production and consumption thresholds
- **Time Scheduling**: Processing time-based mining schedules and restrictions
- **Safety Rules**: Enforcing protective conditions and emergency stops
- **Efficiency Optimization**: Assessing performance metrics and optimization targets
- **Cost Management**: Evaluating energy costs and economic conditions

## Extensibility Features

- **Custom Operators**: Support for specialized comparison and evaluation operators
- **Rule Validators**: Built-in validation for rule syntax and logic consistency

## Integration Points

- **Policy Integration**: Seamless integration with optimization policies for automated decision-making
- **Context Processing**: Efficient handling of complex decisional context data
- **Rule Management**: Support for dynamic rule loading and updating
- **Result Handling**: Clear and consistent evaluation result reporting

This entity provides the computational foundation for smart mining automation, enabling advanced rule-based decision-making that can adapt to complex energy scenarios and operational requirements while maintaining high performance and reliability.
